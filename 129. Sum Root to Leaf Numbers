129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers

You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only.
Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.
For example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -> 2 -> 3 represents the number 123.
Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.
A leaf node is a node with no children.

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 25

Example 2:
Input: root = [4,9,0,5,1]
Output: 1026

Solution:
class Solution {
public:
    int sumNumbers(TreeNode* root) {
        return path(root,0);
    }
    int path(TreeNode* root,int sum){
        if(root==NULL){
            return 0;
        }
        sum = sum * 10 + root->val;
        if(!root->left && !root->right){
            return sum;
        }
        return path(root->left,sum) + path(root->right,sum);
    }
};
